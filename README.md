I’m Marvin — a forward-thinking Software and DevOps Engineer with a passion for building scalable, automated, and intelligent systems that merge software engineering, cloud infrastructure, and machine learning. Over the past few years, I’ve specialized in designing, deploying, and managing end-to-end solutions that bring together the best of DevOps, AI, and modern software development.

About Me

I build and automate systems that bridge development and operations, transforming complex infrastructure into seamless, repeatable workflows. My work sits at the intersection of cloud computing, AI integration, and automation engineering — crafting environments where ideas move from prototype to production without friction.

I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and designing infrastructure that tells a story — one of reliability, performance, and foresight. Whether I’m managing Kubernetes clusters, creating CI/CD pipelines, or integrating LLM-based systems, my goal is always the same: make technology efficient, accessible, and meaningful.

Key Skills and Focus Areas

DevOps & Cloud Engineering: AWS, GCP, Terraform, Kubernetes, Docker, CI/CD (GitHub Actions, Jenkins)

Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Terraform Cloud, CDK for Terraform (Python), modular infrastructure design

AI & Automation Systems: LangChain, LangGraph, RAG pipelines, memory-enabled AI agents

Backend Development: Python (FastAPI, Django), Node.js, Spring Boot

Monitoring & Observability: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack

Scripting & Automation: Bash, Python, GitHub Bots, n8n Workflow Automation

Current Projects

AI Companion Bot System: Building an identity-aware conversational system with memory, RAG, and workflow automation using LangChain and n8n.

Quantitative BTC Trading Engine: Designing a Python-based decision engine using technical and sentiment analysis for crypto futures trading.

Oddspawa Platform: Developing an AI-driven sports prediction site with payment-gated features and mobile-optimized UX.

Professional Highlights

Architected multi-cloud deployments integrating Kubernetes, Terraform, and automated CI/CD pipelines.

Designed reusable Python constructs for defining infrastructure with CDK for Terraform.

Developed full-stack systems combining AI inference, API orchestration, and serverless cloud components.

Trained teams and students in DevOps fundamentals, Git, and Python development through hands-on sessions.

Interests

I’m deeply interested in:

The evolving synergy between AI agents and cloud infrastructure

Self-healing systems and event-driven automation

Quantitative systems, predictive analytics, and applied ML in real-time operations

Teaching, writing, and mentoring engineers to think beyond the immediate problem
